# Employee Burnout Analysis & Prediction

##  Overview
Employee burnout is a growing concern in modern workplaces and can directly impact productivity and employee well-being.  
This project focuses on analyzing employee burnout patterns and predicting burnout levels using machine learning techniques based on work-related and psychological factors.

---

##  Objectives
- Analyze factors contributing to employee burnout
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns
- Build machine learning models to predict burnout
- Identify the most influential features affecting burnout

---

##  Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model building and comparison
- Burnout prediction for new employee data

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **ML Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub  

---

##  Dataset
- Real-world employee dataset
- Includes features such as:
  - Workload
  - Mental Fatigue Score
  - Work-from-Home setup
  - Designation level
  - Resource allocation

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed burnout trends across different employee attributes
- Visualized correlations between features
- Identified **Mental Fatigue Score** as the most influential factor contributing to burnout


##  Model Building
- Implemented and compared:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluated models using performance metrics
- Selected the best-performing model for prediction


##  Results
- Successfully identified key burnout-driving factors
- Random Forest model performed better in capturing non-linear relationships
- Built a prediction function to estimate burnout levels for new employee data
